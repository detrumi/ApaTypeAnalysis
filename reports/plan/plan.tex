\section*{Description}
We will be analysing a subset of the Haskell language. The parser we will be using comes from a project that Wilco made in his spare time (\url{http://github.com/detrumi/hc}). The language will simplify from Haskell a bit. For example no indentation will be used, braces and semicolons will be required instead.
Our subset of the Haskell language will support (in addition to the Lambda calculus):
\begin{itemize}
    \item General data structures
    \item Recursion
    \item Case statements
    \item Let bindings
\end{itemize}
We will at least add one of the following optional features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Polymorphism
    \item Subtyping (Class system)
    \item Syntactic sugar for lists and tuples
\end{itemize}
We will conduct the Control Flow Analysis (with general data structures) to our language.
